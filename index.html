                     <p>We strive to be with those who need help and promise to sweat for the realization and solutions of issues faced by 
                    our fellow mates. It is an organization of the students, for the students, by the students. 
                    We function as two teams-
                    <ul><li> The Central Team</li>
                        <li>The Hall Coordinators Team</li>

                            <p>The Counselling Centre was set up in 2009 by the Dean Of Students&prime; Affairs,
                   IIT Kharagpur as an outcome of his efforts to make the campus a better campus for
                    the entire student community.</p> 
                    <p> It provided the students a place where they could
                     easily approach with a problem and leave with a solution. The reach of the Counselling
                      Centre was further extended through the Hall Coordinators Team. However, the increasing strength of students in the 
                      campus called for active participation from the students themselves in this noble cause. 
                      This was the scenario which saw the establishment of the Student Welfare Group in August 2011.</p>
                      <p> 
                      Student Welfare Group was initially an idea evolved out of a feeling to perpetuate and nurture a campus life which is hassle-free. 
                      Today, we are a dedicated lot willing to sort out various issues of concern for the students.
                       In time to come, we will definitely emerge to be a more successful organization with more activities managed and implemented 
                       for the welfare of students.

                      <p> We at SWG, infact come forward to find the issues of concern for the student community and thereon, 
                        try to find a feasible solution to the problem. Workshops and classes are frequently held to encounter problems that the students 
                        are likely to face. </p>
                        <p>Thus, the activities of SWG are more event oriented. We are perpetually involved in planning and efficient 
                        implementation of programs in pursuit of our mission. SWG aids in the blossoming of the overall personality of each and every student,

                            <p>Most people associate ALCOHOL with fun, with being sociable and with celebrations. We may also use it to help us feel better when we are tense or unhappy, or to feel more confident. But the truth is <b>"70 per cent of the hospital related accidents are alcohol related".</b> </p>
                              <p>One snag is that, although alcohol initially acts as a 'pick-you-up' and mood - enhancer, it is ultimately a depressant; so a heavy night drinking is likely to leave you feeling worse rather than better. Also, the more you drink, and the more often you drink, the more of it you need to feel the same effects. Individuals often are not aware how much they are drinking or its impact on those around them. If you recognise the presence of any of the following, it is time to do something about it:</p>
                              <ul style="margin-left:20px;">

                                Your studies may be suffering with difficulties in concentration, mood swings and having to contend with feelings of guilt.

                                Relationships with others may be dwindling, and your outlook and lifestyle restricted by a need to consume alcohol.

                              Keep a diary of intake in units to clarify your pattern of use and quantities. Cutting down as soon as possible works best if you set limits for yourself, that you feel you might reasonably stick to.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                              Identify those occasions, times of day, companions, or moods when you are prone to use. Try to avoid them as much as possible.
                              </li>
                              <li>
                              It might also help to try to cut down your intake with the support of a group. Increase your participation in your social circle.

                              Rather than labelling them, focus on the effects drink is having on others, as well as on themselves.

                              <li>

                                This is the term used to describe the placing of a new frame of reference around our thoughts. "My friend is usually late, if she really liked and respected me she would not keep me hanging around" might become: "This is part of her easy-going nature that I like so much. She is like that with everyone and doesn't mean any harm by it."

For example: "I feel angry when you make arrangements without telling me and expect me to go along or get left behind. I feel as if you have no respect for me". Rather than 'You have no respect for me, it's no wonder I get so angry".</li>
                                        <li> <b>F</b> -Freedom. Allow people the freedom to deal with their problems as they see fit. It's no good getting cross because they can't see the wisdom of your approach; it just makes things worse.</li>

                                Using the L.I.F.E. model will give you a framework to help you to address things that make you angry quickly without escalating the situation into a conflict. 'Stewing' in your angry feelings, or 'swallowing' them in order to pretend that it doesn't matter, can lead to the development of depression and feelings of hopelessness, or 'temper explosions' which in extreme cases can be linked to violent outbursts.</ul></li></ul>

                                <h3 style="text-align:center">Anxiety</h3>
                        <p>Anxiety is a normal emotional and physiological response to feeling threatened. People differ as to how vulnerable they feel in different situations: this can be influenced by past experiences as well as by the beliefs and attitudes they hold about these situations.<br><br>
                Some general situations which often cause anxiety include:</p>
                          <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                            <li> Leaving home and / or adapting to life at university</li>
                            <li> Dealing with relationships or the lack of relationships</li>
                            <li> Panic about facing exams or making a presentation</li>
                            <li> Worrying about social acceptance and approval, or about failure, criticism or rejection from others</li>
                          </ul>
                          <br/>
                          <p>The experience of anxiety can range from mild uneasiness and worry to severe panic. At a reasonable level, short bursts of anxiety can motivate us and enhance our performance, but if anxiety becomes too severe or chronic, however, it can become debilitating.</p>
                          <h3 style="text-align:center">How you can help yourself?</h3>
                          First of all, you need to know that anxiety is entirely normal. Everyone feels anxious when they are in a stressful situation where they feel vulnerable,             so being anxious does not mean that you are 'weak' or 'abnormal'. Here are some strategies you can try for yourself:
                            <ul style="margin-left:20px;">
                                <li> Review the stressful circumstances in your life and work on its different aspects.</li>
                                <li> Distract yourself from every unpleasant thing.</li>
                                <li> Face the difficult situation with full confidence and accept the results with happiness.</li>
                                <li> Work on relaxing yourself, and develop some tricks to do so.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 style="text-align:center">What are Panic Attacks?</h3>
                            <p>A panic attack is a severe experience of anxiety. People may feel intense dread, experience various physical symptoms and have extreme thoughts of           losing control, going mad, having a heart attack or dying. It is also possible to become afraid of panic attacks themselves because the experience can be so unpleasant.
                            <br/>
                Although panic attacks can be very frightening, they are not actually harmful - people do not actually have heart attacks, develop psychiatric illnesses or die from them!</p>
                            <p>Here are some strategies to help in the event of a panic attack:</p>
                            <ul style="margin-left:20px">
                                <li> Remind yourself that a panic attack will end!</li>
                                <li> Remind yourself that panic attacks are not actually dangerous!</li>
                                <li> Remind yourself of any previous occasions when you handled a similar situation well.</li>
                                <li> Picture a person you trust or who cares about you and imagine the person is with you offering encouragement.</li>
                                <li> Focus on the present moment and on the things around (outside of) you - observe their shape, colour, sounds.</li>
                                <li> Stop what you are doing and slow yourself down for a moment! Breathe more slowly and gently (though not actually holding your breath). Then continue what you were doing slowly.</li>
                                <li> Take a big sigh, stretch out, and then flop and relax.</li>
                                <li> If you are able, take some gentle exercise, e.g. go for a stroll.</li>
                                <li> Get angry! Don't let this anxiety (or situation) get the better of you!</li>
                                </ul>
                                <h3 style="text-align:center">When to seek further help?</h3>
                                <p>Anxiety can affect your health only when it becomes chronic and severe, so it is important that you seek help if you think that this is the case:                    </p>
                                <ul style="margin-left:3%">
                                    <li> If the anxiety problems do not start to improve despite trying the ideas above.</li>
                                    <li> If your fears are persistent and difficult to control.</li>
                                    <li> If your anxiety is stopping you from living a normal life, or if you are avoiding important activities.</li>
                                </ul>

                            <p>Concentration has been defined as "the ability to direct one's thinking in whatever direction one would intend".
                    We all have the ability to concentrate some of the time. But at other times our thoughts are scattered, and our minds race from one thing to another. To deal with such times, we need to learn and practice concentration skills and strategies.<br />
                    Our ability to concentrate depends on:

                              <h3 style="text-align:center">Expanding your concentration span:</h3>
                              <p>People sometimes refer to a concentration span: this is the time we can concentrate on a specific task before our thoughts wander. In learning concentration skills, we aim to extend our concentration span - bearing in mind that we will have a different span for different tasks. It cannot be expanded to infinity! Most people find their level for most tasks round about an hour, but for some people and some tasks it will just be a few minutes, while for others it might be two or three hours.<br />
                    If you want to improve your concentration, start by practising this:</p>
                              <ul style="margin-left:3%">
                                <li> <b>STOP:</b> <br />
                                    This sounds very simple, but it works. When you notice your thoughts wandering, say to yourself STOP and then gently bring your attention back to       where you want it to be. Each time it wanders bring it back. To begin with, this could be several times a minute. But each time, say STOP and then re-focus.</li>
                                <li> <b>Worry time:</b><br />
                                Set aside one or more specific periods in the day when you are allowed to worry. It can help to set them just before something that you know you will       do, to ensure that you stop worrying on time - e.g. before a favourite TV programme, or a meal-time. Whenever an anxiety or distracting thought enters your mind during the day, banish it until your next worry time, and re-focus on to what you are supposed to be doing.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <br />

                         <p style="text-align:center;"> <i><b>"Am I depressed - or is it something else?"</b></i></p>
                                    <p>Our mood naturally varies over time and from day to day and everyone gets down sometimes. We may say that we are 'down', 'fed up', or 'feeling under the pressure'; we may get disheartened about something that happens or when things don't go the way we would have liked. As it always doesn't happen the way we want. If we suffer a major loss, we readily understand that it is normal to grieve. Sometimes, though, past losses which were not fully mourned at the time may later resurface. Sometimes you don't even able to understand what is actually troubling you.
                        Depression includes a persistent low mood and loss of interest or pleasure in life or no joy in doing the work which in past you like to do the most, you know the most passionate interest of yours'- it also commonly involves:</p>

                                    <li> Negative thoughts, feelings of worthlessness wrong beliefs, withdrawing into owns space</li>
                                    <li> Loss of enthusiasm and short-tempered</li>
                                    <li> You feel listless, or 'can't be bothered' or things feel pointless</li>  
                                    <li> Feel that it just not worth going on, or think about suicide </li> 
                                 </ul>
                                  <p>Someone who is depressed will experience a number of these changes persisting for quite some  time.</p>
                                 <h3 style="text-align:center">Why do people get depressed?</h3>
                                  <p>Often depression is a response to events or circumstances that are felt to be deeply troublesome or distressing, or which seem to threaten our personal         identity. Usually these circumstances seem too hard or even impossible to change. There can be a sense of powerlessness, hopelessness and an all-pervasive gloom                       <br />
                        However, sometimes people seem to get depressed for no obvious reason. In these cases, it may be that something that hurt deeply some time ago (even years ago) begins to surface now.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Usually the disappointment passes with time, and people find that they can come to terms with what has happened and start to look forward to the future in a more positive way. However, if the low mood is frequent or persists, or seems so severe that it affects your ability to function normally, it is time to seek out some help.</p>
                                    <h3 style="text-align:center">Negative thinking</h3>
                                    <p>When people are depressed they usually find themselves thinking very negative thoughts about themselves and the world; typically these thoughts are felt to be absolutely true and that there is no way of things ever changing. However, studies have shown that when people are no longer depressed they go back to seeing things in a more positive and balanced way.</p>
                                    <p>Negative thoughts are usually -</p>
                                    <ul style="margin-left:3%">
                                    <li> Nobody likes me; I'm worthless; I'm a failure; I will be criticized; I will be rejected. </li>
                                    <li> Nobody will ever want to have a relationship with me. </li>
                                    <li> Any place doesn't give peace of mind; each place seems to be hollow. </li>
                                    <li> I don't fit in; I'm different; I will always be alone; it's hopeless.</li>

                                <h3 style="text-align:center">How to help yourself ?</h3>
                                <p>There are some things you can try which have been shown to help lift a depressed mood. These involve changing your behavior and challenging your negative thoughts.</p>
                                <p>
                        People who are depressed often stop doing pleasurable activities or the things about which they were passionate in their past, the things which makes them feel better in the short term. Encourage yourself to start doing things again - activity can lift your mood and you may well find that you can do things better than you imagine. Any activity will be helpful, but enjoyable activities and physical exercise/sport are particularly effective.
                                </p>

                            <li> Simply don't give yourself free time to think about your problem, just always keep yourself indulge in some or other activities.</li>
                            <li> Start with easier tasks and then progress to more difficult ones: this will help you to regain your confidence and will boost up your mood.</li>
                            <li> Be realistic ,reward yourself for your achievements.</li>
                            <li> Develop a new hobby or area of interest and indulge yourself in it.</li>
                            <li>It is very important to spend time with people who are supportive. Isolating yourself increases depression, while social support helps lift a low mood.</li>

                                                 Your attitude after the exam is also important especially if you have another exam. The following points will be helpful to you to maintain your calm and composure after the exam.

                                                        <li> It is a good idea to decide what you are going to do after the exam. You can leave others to do the post-mortem of the paper outside the Lecture Hall, while you go and do something more enjoyable as already planned or take rest.</li>
                                                        <li> If you have another exam and you are not satisfied with your performance in the first exam, you may get stressed and spoil your other exam as well. In such a case:

                    The medium of instruction in IIT Kharagpur is English. The thesis work and assignment submissions are to be done in English, also all text and reference material is available in English. Your job interview would be carried out in English. IITKGP has students from different cultural and regional backgrounds. Therefore, wide usage of English may be a matter of concern to many. Many students who have not had a good background in English find it difficult to cope up with academics. This troubles them and they find themselves standing nowhere. If you are also facing a similar problem, let us tell you that you need not worry because there is a way out to this problem. You just need to put in a bit of effort. As you have made it to this institute, you have enough brain to do well in academics. This also goes for people who can speak proper English but are weak in public speaking. With some endeavour on your part, you can improve your English skills.
                    </p>
                              <ul style="margin-left:3%">
                                <li> Read English books and newspapers mark the words you don't understand and look for their meaning in the dictionary. This will improve your English vocabulary. You may understand nothing when you begin reading these books but don't feel sad, just go on and you'll find yourself improving day by day.</li>
                                <li> Talk to your friends in English. Don't hesitate if you speak wrong English. You will improve only when you give it a start.</li>
                                <li> Don't run away from academics just because you don't understand English. Try to understand the terms, ask your friends to help you grasp the study material. Feel free to discuss your doubts with the tutors and instructors.</li>

                                <p>    
                    Many students coming to college, and maybe leaving home for the first time, feel homesick. Even those who didn't ever expect to be hit by homesickness can suddenly find themselves missing the familiarity of home and friends, and don't know quite how to cope with the resulting emotions. This is entirely normal and passes, usually in the first term, and often within the first few weeks.   It is really important to realize that you are not the only one feeling homesick and that it doesn't in any way mean you are inadequate.</p>
                              <h3 style="text-align:center">What can you do to help yourself?</h3>
                              <p>Most importantly, acknowledge your feelings and accept them. Believe that they will pass. They almost always do.   Decide whether the best policy for you is to have frequent contact with home or little contact. If you happen to be a localite, we will recommend you not visiting home very frequently, and try staying in hostels so that you can spend more time with your friends. Make a real effort to join various clubs, develop a new hobby. This might feel very difficult, but the more you feel part of campus life, the less homesick you will feel.</p>

                                <p>    
                    It is a clich that we can feel lonely - even particularly lonely - in a crowd. Unfortunately it is one that is only too true and all too common at university. Here, surrounded by people of a similar age and, supposedly, with lots in common we can nevertheless feel wretchedly isolated and awkward. This is made worse by the sight of others who seem perfectly at ease, are rapidly making friends and are becoming embedded in groups from which you feel excluded or only tolerated on the margins. Feelings of Loneliness Occur to Us All - Sometimes we are thrown into that sense of uniqueness and the awareness that no-one can ever fully know and understand us. In fact, occasionally we may feel that we do not even understand ourselves! This is because we are constantly changing in response to the situations and relationships that we develop.</p>

                              <p>Loneliness can:</p>

                                <li> lead to feelings of worthlessness. </li>
                                <li>cause you to withdraw from social contact and the outside world.</li> 
                                <li> result in disappointed expectations and spoil your enjoyment of the university.</li>
                                <li> adversely affect your physical and emotional health.</li>

                            <h3 style="text-align:center">Ways of Coping:</h3>
                            <p>
                     Loneliness is a normal part of human experience. It can even have positive effects, if it doesn't last for too long - for example, it can lead to the discovery and development of personal resources and, therefore, to a greater sense of your own independence. If it becomes long-lasting, however, it can cause great distress and hurt. Here are some suggestions for ways you may find helpful in breaking the pattern of your loneliness:</p>          
                             <ul style="margin-left:20px">
                                <li> <b>Self-Acceptance</b>:<br />
                    You may blame yourself for your loneliness wishing you were different ('If only I were ...'); it can be helpful to realise that it may be your situation you need to change, rather than your personality or appearance. You are all right, the situation isn't - and you can do something about that.</li>
                                <li> <b> Making Friends:</b><br /> 
                                    <ul style="margin-left:10px">
                                        <li><b> Accept your own preferences:</b> You may prefer one-to-one friendships to group contact; you may prefer quieter meeting places to pubs or clubs.</li>
                                        <li><b> Choose activities you are genuinely interested in:</b> Whatever these are (societies, sports, voluntary work, arts, music, etc.), you will meet people there with whom you have something in common.</li>
                                        <li> <b>Risk taking the initiative:</b> Your reticence can be misunderstood by others as aloofness or unfriendliness - for example, if you are feeling lonely in a lecture, avoiding eye-contact and pretending you're fine by absorbing yourself in a book or paper, you may be putting others off from contacting you. If you stop and look around you, you may well find others sitting on their own, who would welcome a smile from you and, perhaps, an offer of coffee in the break.</li>
                                        <li> <b>Build upon your relationship by being a good friend:</b> Listening carefully, being responsive and showing understanding and even challenging sometimes, if it feels appropriate. (Deepening a few relationships can be more rewarding than pursuing many casual ones.)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3 style="text-align:center">Sources of Help </h3>
                            <p>A research done showed that students, who had been feeling lonely, said that the greatest help was talking about their feelings to someone who listened, cared, understood and accepted them. So if you look around yourself, you can always find your batch mates, seniors, counselling service members, your parents, faculty, who are always ready to help you. Don't have any hesitation in talking to them and taking their help.</p>

                                <h3 style="text-align:center">Procrastination</h3>
                                  <p>The avoidance of doing a task which needs to be done - postponing until tomorrow what can be done today. Procrastination not only affects a person's work, but also commonly involves feelings such as guilt, inadequacy, self-disgust, stress and depression. Often we try to disguise our avoidance by being very busy doing things that may be interesting, and even useful, but don't contribute towards the main goal.</p>

                                    <li> Once started it is often easier to keep going. Make a start on an easy task then switch quickly to a difficult one.</li>
                                    <li> Stop telling yourself you must do really well. Remind yourself that doing it is what matters.</li>
                                    <li> Boost your motivation; dwell on your strengths, on tasks which you have accomplished.</li>
                                    <li> Plan rewards for when you have accomplished something.</li>

                                  <p>Here are some guidelines for a good night's rest! Hopefully, this will help you swim against the current trend of 'night-outs' in Kharagpur.</p>
                                  <ul type="none">
                        <li><b> Exercise</b> during the day, preferably in the late evening before dinner. Do not exercise within 4 hours of going to bed. Aerobic exercise (not necessarily 'aerobics', but the type that gets you sweating for 20 minutes or more) is best, but 45 minutes to an hour of brisk walking will work.</li>
                        <li><b> Regular Bedtime / Wake Time</b> to go to bed and get up at regular times, even if you are tired in the morning. Do not vary your time of going to bed or getting up. However if you have consistent sleep problems, try getting up half an hour earlier in the morning than your usual time; it may help you get to sleep that night.</li>
                        <li><b> Do not Fight and Fret about Sleeplessness</b>. Do not try to make yourself sleep. If you are unable to fall asleep after 20 - 30 minutes, leave your bed, engage in some relaxing activity (such as watching TV, sitting in a chair and listening to a relaxation tape, or having a cup of herbal tea), and do not return to bed until you are sleepy. Repeat until you fall asleep. Also work not to worry, get upset, fight or fear sleeplessness. Even if tired the next day, your adrenaline should keep you functioning adequately for the tasks you most need to accomplish.</li>
                        <li><b> Meals before Sleep</b>: No heavy meals right before bedtime. Avoid stimulating or spicy foods. Eat a small snack about two hours before bedtime. A good choice would be a banana and a glass of milk. Some people also find drinking a glass of milk 30 minutes before sleeping is helpful.</li>
                        <li> <b>No Stimulants.</b> Avoid caffeine, sugar or other stimulants within 4 hours of going to bed. Avoid even moderate use during the day. If you must have some, do so only in the morning and have small amounts.</li>
                        <li><b> Sleep Ritual</b>: Develop a 30-minute or more sleep ritual before bedtime. This is a relaxing activity you do every night in the same order at about the same time before you get into bed. A hot shower, bath, or other relaxing or inspirational reading activity may be helpful.</li>
                        <li><b> Sleep Restriction</b>: Cut down on time in bed not sleeping. Estimate average total hours currently actually sleeping, i.e.- 7 hours.</li> <li><b> Determine time of day you wake up</b>, i.e., 8am. Subtract sleep hours from the wake time (i.e., 8am - 7 hours = 1am.) Go to bed at this time. Make sure to get up at the regular wake time, and take no naps. </li>
                        <li><b> The Bed is for Sleep</b>. Eliminate non - sleep activities in bed (such as reading or doing other work) to strengthen associations between your bed and sleeping (unless these other activities are part of your sleep ritual).</li>
                        <li><b> Naps</b>: Only take quick 'power' naps no longer than 20 minutes and no later than the afternoon.</li>
                        <li><b> Thoughts</b>: Keep a notebook by your bed. If something is on your mind, you can get some peace by writing it down, knowing it will be there when you wake up. Then focus on positive thoughts.</li></ul>

                            <hr class="colored">
                            <p>This initiative of Student Welfare Group has made an impact on a large number of lives on the campus. This programme included the guidance and mentorship of every single first year student by a 3 rd or 4th year student of his very own department. The objective of this programme is to help the first years understand the various aspects of college life, and adapt accordingly. This programme ensures that the hindsight of the Mentor becomes the foresight of the Mentee. The Mentees can benefit immensely from the insight of the Mentor and find the best possible way to utilize their time in the campus. The Student Mentor Programme provides scope for constructive and productive interaction between the freshmen and the experienced seniors , which forms an integral part of college life.</p>
                            <h3>Student Mentor Programme 2014</h3>
                            <p>Like the earlier versions of the programme, Student Mentor Programme 2014 also had at its roots, the core objective of encouraging productive interaction and providing effective guidance to first year students by experienced seniors. The programme provides a reliable and comprehensive support system for the student community to motivate students to excel in both academic and non-academic fields and to make the most of their life at IIT Kharagpur and beyond. The programme continues to help the undergraduate first year students understand the challenges and opportunities present in IIT Kharagpur and to develop a smooth transition to campus life. It also provides positive role models to them, thus providing them with guidance to make the best use of their time in the next 4-5 years of their stay at IIT Kharagpur. The Mentor to Mentee ratio averages out to be 1:5 for SMP-14. It is a three semester long programme and will continue from the first autumn semester of the novice up to the autumn semester of his second year.
